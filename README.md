# CS576-Tetris-Sample

So I genuinly tried to get some search tree stuff going and then it just wasn't working so I fell back on just using a heuristic. For some reason pieces also move two spaces sometimes on the enemy side. I'm not sure why and I spent way too long trying to debug it.

1. Clone this repo
2. Open it in a 2021 version of Unity
3. 2xClick TetrisScene (in Assets/Scenes)
4. Hit run?

Apologies for the mess. YMMV.
